This folder contains CloudForms Service Dialogs which can be used with (some) of the provided Playbooks.

They have been tweaked to be a bit more user friendly, by utilizing the MIQExpression feature of CloudForms 4.6 which makes it easy to build dynamic dialogs.

The CloudForms Automate Domain which contains these Methods, can be found in the [CloudForms Demo](https://gitlab.com/cjung/cloudforms-demo) Repository.
